# TradeShop

### Updated to 1.13 by Dart2112

## 1.13 Update Notes

Changes in 1.13 mean that numerical item IDs don't exist anymore,
as such the following things have changed:

IDs are not reported when using the item command

You must write item names on signs, e.g. "stone" instead of "1".
This was something you could do before but it is now enforced since there is no
elegant way to get materials from IDs in 1.13

## Description
This plugin manages how players trade one item for another. The concept behind it is very simple, you just place a chest and a sign on top, then write all the information on the sign.
